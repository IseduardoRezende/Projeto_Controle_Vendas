Sales Management System

The software has access levels that are the Administrator and Salesperson level. With the Administrator the employee will have access to all the system's functionalities.
Well, the system has as main functionalities the Registration, Consultation and Change of Customers, Employees, Suppliers and Products,
in addition we have the Sales of Products where the employees insert the customer's CPF and add the product code to make the purchase, so our customer manages to acquire several products,
the software provides the Payments function, with this, right after the purchase you will have the stock of the product(s) purchased reduced.

The system was developed with the help of my teacher Caio Malheiros of ETEC. 
Thanks for attention;  :)
